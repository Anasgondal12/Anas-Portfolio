      <h2>Reflective Discussion of My Module Experience</h2>
      <p>
        It is a fun and challenging learning process about the basics of web
        development. Over the course of the term I learned about HTML, CSS, and
        JavaScript, which issued me with knowledge of how websites function and
        how to build engaging user experiences. I knew HTML very well so
        creating pages became easy but styling them with CSS was a bit difficult
        and making it responsive.
      </p>

      <h2>Development Process</h2>
      <p>
        My website was developed in an orderly fashion. I started whereby you
        plan your layout using wireframes and sketches before implementing the
        design in HTML and CSS. I started to use JavaScript as I went along
        to incorporate interactive elements like live content refreshes and form
        validation. Browser developer tools came in handy, especially during the
        debugging phase. for resolving layout shifts and JavaScript errors.
      </p>

      <h2>Design Decisions</h2>
      <p>
        Out of necessity I had to design for the UI of my website, I wanted it
        to be an extremely simple and readable as possible. I chose Montserrat
        for the headings and Open Sans for the body text so you’ll have a
        professional and modern feel. It is a combination of blue (#007BFF) &
        white (#FFFFFF), gives fresh and beautiful contrast. Two helpful sources
        of inspiration that provided were w3schools and CSS Tricks. great design
        insights.

      <!-- <h2>Video Demonstration</h2>
      <p>
        To showcase my project, I recorded a walkthrough video demonstrating the
        key features and design elements. You can watch the video
      </p> -->

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        This experience has sharpened my coding, design and debugging skills.
        And now I have learned a little bit more about making friendly pages and
        small development problems. What I want to Learn from Next — From next,
        I want to learn about framework type Bootstrap, and Useful JavaScript
        libraries and hints to become an expert web developer.
